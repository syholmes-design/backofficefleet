## Plain-English rollback explanation

If this change needs to be undone, restore the prior behavior by:

1. Review the reverse note at `.codex/change-memory/reverse-instructions/2026-05-22-12-53-51-layout-squeeze-sweep-fixes.md`.
2. Reverse-apply the patch if it still matches the current files.
3. If the patch cannot apply, use the reconstruction note at `.codex/change-memory/reconstruction-notes/2026-05-22-12-53-51-layout-squeeze-sweep-fixes.md`.

## Rebuild notes if backup fails

If the original files are gone, recreate the previous version by:

2. Rebuild the prior behavior from the reverse instructions.
3. Re-run the listed validation checks.
