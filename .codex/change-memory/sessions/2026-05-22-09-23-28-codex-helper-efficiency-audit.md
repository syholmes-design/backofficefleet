## Exact change record

Patch file: .codex/change-memory/patches/2026-05-22-09-23-28-codex-helper-efficiency-audit.patch
Reverse instruction file: .codex/change-memory/reverse-instructions/2026-05-22-09-23-28-codex-helper-efficiency-audit.md

## Plain-English rollback explanation

If this change needs to be undone, restore the prior behavior by:

1. Review the reverse note at `.codex/change-memory/reverse-instructions/2026-05-22-09-23-28-codex-helper-efficiency-audit.md`.
2. Reverse-apply the patch if it still matches the current files.
3. If the patch cannot apply, use the reconstruction note at `.codex/change-memory/reconstruction-notes/2026-05-22-09-23-28-codex-helper-efficiency-audit.md`.

## Rebuild notes if backup fails

If the original files are gone, recreate the previous version by:

1. Use the file list and summaries in this entry.
2. Rebuild the prior behavior from the reverse instructions.
3. Re-run the listed validation checks.

## Validation after reconstruction
