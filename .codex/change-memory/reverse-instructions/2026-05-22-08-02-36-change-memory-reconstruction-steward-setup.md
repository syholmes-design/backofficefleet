## Plain-English rollback explanation

If this change needs to be undone, restore the prior behavior by:

1. Review the patch at `.codex/change-memory/patches/2026-05-22-08-02-36-change-memory-reconstruction-steward-setup.patch`.
2. If the patch still applies cleanly, reverse it with `git apply -R .codex/change-memory/patches/2026-05-22-08-02-36-change-memory-reconstruction-steward-setup.patch` from the project root.
3. If the patch does not apply cleanly, manually restore the behavior described in this note and the reconstruction note.
