# Reverse Instructions

ID: 2026-05-22-no-fake-buttons-demo-pass
Date: 2026-05-22T12:12:15.095Z
Area changed: No fake buttons demo pass
Reason for change: Converted demo-adjacent view/review/preview buttons into real links or disabled states, added a draft save response where a visible action was previously inert, and confirmed no plain button elements remain without a handler or disabled state.

## Plain-English rollback explanation

If this change needs to be undone, restore the prior behavior by:

1. Review the patch at `.codex/change-memory/patches/2026-05-22-12-12-15-no-fake-buttons-demo-pass.patch`.
2. If the patch still applies cleanly, reverse it with `git apply -R .codex/change-memory/patches/2026-05-22-12-12-15-no-fake-buttons-demo-pass.patch` from the project root.
3. If the patch does not apply cleanly, manually restore the behavior described in this note and the reconstruction note.

## Validation after reconstruction
